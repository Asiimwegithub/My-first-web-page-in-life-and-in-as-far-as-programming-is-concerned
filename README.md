# This was not my first but what i called my first amazing web page in life. I think i had taken about 3 weeks in a class of IT but i knew nothing.
My regards goes to Andela Learning community for the good job they did in me.
and more in particular i thank Mr. Abahurire Edison who was a volunteer for Andela Level_Up by then.
